## The task is

Create page by `Design_Architecture.psd` layout

#### Technical requirements for your page:
- All sections in the top half of the site (top menu, `The latest news`, `Most popular posts`)  must be done using Flexbox
- All sections in the bottom half of the site (`Our most popular clients`, `Top rated`, `Hot news`, footer) must be done using CSS Grid Layout
- Background images should be attached to the background and should not move with the scroll, but different images should be shown between different blocks.
- An example of how this property works you can see [here](./Preview.gif)

For your convenience, the full versions of all background images are placed in a separate [folder] (img) and are given together with the design

#### Note: 
This homework includes three lessons - Flexbox, CSS Grid, Animation / Parallax
 - After the Flexbox lesson, you need to look at the top of the layout
 - After the CSS Grid lesson, you need to look at the bottom of the layout
 - After the Animation / Parallax lesson, it is necessary to fix the background images at the scroll.

#### An optional advanced complexity task:
- Complete a second version of this design where the background images between the blocks will move slower than the main blocks with text, but there must still be different images between the different blocks
