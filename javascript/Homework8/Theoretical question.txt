1.Explain in your own words how you understand what an event handler is?
Answer: Due to apply user actions, input etc. on web page needs to use event handlers. For instance, if we want to see some action when page loads or is closed
or when user click a button, press some keyboard , add some data in a given field we need to apply some event such as onclick,onchange,onmouseover
onload and etc.
