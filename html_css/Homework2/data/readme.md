## The task is

Create page by `RamdaJS.psd` layout.

#### Technical requirements for your page:
- Page width must be fixed (1280 pixels, as in the layout), all content must be located in the center of the screen
- The Ramda.js logo at the top should be made by text, as a clickable link
- The upper menu should be in the center of the block
- The picture in the frame must be centered horizontally and vertically
- The copyright special symbol must be used in the right side of the footer
- Blocks that whould be arranged horizontally using the CSS property `display: inline-block` is: upper menu, side menu, footer menu, block with picture. 

##### An optional advanced complexity task:
- Make the items of each of the menus looks like as on the layout when you put the mouse cursor over them
- If you put the mouse cursor inside the picture frame, zoom in the picture a little bit (the transition should be smooth) - an example can be seen in `image_scale.gif`
